# batch-script-to-django-runserver
To runserver django app with batch script file

This batch script will get your IP Adress then run the server based on your IP Address.
<br>The same result with if you run: `python manage.py runserver your_ip_address:80`

To use this script, you just need to put the file in your django app root (in the same level with your manage.py). Then double click it. 
<br>The IP Address shown in the command prompt is the url of your app. Make sure the device is in the same network with the server.

Have fun~
